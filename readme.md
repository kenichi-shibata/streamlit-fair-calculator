# Streamlit FAIR Calculator

The Streamlit FAIR Calculator is an interactive tool that utilizes the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) methodology to analyze and quantify information risk in financial terms. This tool can aid organizations in making informed decisions about cybersecurity, risk management, and IT investments by estimating potential losses from risk events.

## Features

- Calculate Loss Event Frequency (LEF) and Loss Magnitude (LM) using the FAIR model.
- Simulate various risk scenarios and their financial impact.
- Visualize Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) through interactive charts.
- Generate and view summary statistics including primary and secondary risk metrics.
- Assess vulnerability percentages based on simulation results.

## Getting Started
